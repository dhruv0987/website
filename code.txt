<h1>How does a pulley work ?</h1>
  <h3><p>what is a pulley ?</p></h3>
     <p>Pulleys are mechanisms compost by wheel and rope used to lift heavy objects onto tall heights.
     <p>They change the direction of an applied force and they can even reduce the force needed to lift a weight.</p>
     <p>Pulleys systems are commonly used in constructions.</p>
   <h3><p>how does a pulley make work easier?</p></h3>
     <p>A pulley with one wheel allows you to reverse the direction of your lifting force by pulling down on a rope (that's looped over the wheel), lifting your weight.</p> With a two-wheel pulley, you reduce the effort you exert to lift the same amount of weight.</p><p> The larger your ME, the less force you need to lift a weight.</p>
    <h3><p>Formula no pulley</p></h3>

<p>S = F                                  (1)</p>

<p>where</p>

<p>S = effort force (N, lb)</p>

<p> = load (N, lb)</p>

<h3><p>Formula fixed pulley</p></h3>

<p>S = F                                (2)</p>

<p><h1>should we stop if we fail something?</h1></p>
    <p>No,if we fail something we should not quit if something fails we should try again and again until you achieve that goal.</p>
    <p>life is hard,challenging and beautiful.every one goes through failures.Its not like you will fail all the time. </p>
    <p>everyone will be successful if we keep on trying. Nobody cannot build a A.I. robot fully walkable in their first try.</p>
    <p>we should always search what was the mistake evry time we fail and rectify that.</p>
    <p>Everybody will win one time</p>

	<h1>About Dhruvesh</h1>
	<p>When I was little I was always learning about how things work,
	black hole,proogramming,game and solutions for every problem that occurs to me...</p><p>.I just didnt tell that to anybody because i wanted to learn more and more before i could tell someone about the things that I kept learning easily and going deep into every category that i listed above....</p><p>my only setback was that i am not being challenged in school they taught us that I had already learnt but I couldnt let anyone know,because i had a feeling that i would be like a individual nobody would like me read the more complex things that</p><p>I am learning now so I felt it wasnt a good idea.So,I started working on a plan called S.C.H.O.O.L. in which i was just acting like a normal schoolboy that comes first grade and second grade sometimes i will reply a big answer that no one would understand...but when i read stephen hawking black hole theory I was amazed that the black hole that NASA took that black hole was just one of billions of blackholes that sent radiation in space..</p><p>I am doing a project right now that is based on black holes and quantum physics.nothing is impossible in maths and science.If we use it just right.I have a upcoming project that is going to be on speed of light</p><p>and the thing that i was curious about was everything complicated and simple.I am going to try to break speed of light and go to mars WE WILL!!! Hawking radiation is black-body radiation that is predicted to be released by black holes due to quantum effects near the black hole event horizon. </p><p>i haave found a way to go speed of light..1.you we need to measure what is the speed of light in whole number2.we need to get a space ship into orbit3. we need to give the spaceship in orbit as much fuel we need to push the rockket as to break the speed of light</p><p><h1>why space?</h1></p><p>in space there will be less drag in space if we avoid gravitational pull of anything os the speed will n </p><p>the thing that you read was all created with python and flask by myself....</p><a href="/blog">Visit my blog!</a>
