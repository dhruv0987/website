	<h1>About Dhruvesh</h1>
	<p>When I was little I was always learning about how things work,
	black hole,proogramming,game and solutions for every problem that occurs to me...</p><p>.I just didnt tell that to anybody because i wanted to learn more and more before i could tell someone about the things that I kept learning easily and going deep into every category that i listed above....</p><p>my only setback was that i am not being challenged in school they taught us that I had already learnt but I couldnt let anyone know,because i had a feeling that i would be like a individual nobody would like me read the more complex things that</p><p>I am learning now so I felt it wasnt a good idea.So,I started working on a plan called S.C.H.O.O.L. in which i was just acting like a normal schoolboy that comes first grade and second grade sometimes i will reply a big answer that no one would understand...but when i read stephen hawking black hole theory I was amazed that the black hole that NASA took that black hole was just one of billions of blackholes that sent radiation in space..</p><p>I am doing a project right now that is based on black holes and quantum physics.nothing is impossible in maths and science.If we use it just right.I have a upcoming project that is going to be on speed of light</p><p>and the thing that i was curious about was everything complicated and simple.I am going to try to break speed of light and go to mars WE WILL!!! Hawking radiation is black-body radiation that is predicted to be released by black holes due to quantum effects near the black hole event horizon. </p><p>i haave found a way to go speed of light..1.you we need to measure what is the speed of light in whole number2.we need to get a space ship into orbit3. we need to give the spaceship in orbit as much fuel we need to push the rockket as to break the speed of light</p><p><h1>why space?</h1></p><p>in space there will be less drag in space if we avoid gravitational pull of anything os the speed will n </p><p>the thing that you read was all created with python and flask by myself....</p><a href="/blog">Visit my blog!</a>
